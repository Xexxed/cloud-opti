# Feature Requirements

## Core Functionality

### 1. Input Processing
- **GitHub Repository Integration**
  - Repository URL input and validation
  - Code analysis to detect technology stack
  - Dependency parsing (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
  - Architecture pattern detection

- **Manual Stack Selection**
  - Technology stack picker interface
  - Framework and language selection
  - Database and storage requirements
  - Expected traffic and scale inputs

### 2. Architecture Analysis Engine
- **Service Recommendation Logic**
  - Map technologies to optimal cloud services
  - Consider cost vs performance trade-offs
  - Factor in scaling requirements
  - Multi-cloud service comparison

- **Cost Optimization Rules**
  - Prefer managed services for operational efficiency
  - Suggest reserved instances for predictable workloads
  - Recommend spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
  - Consider serverless options for variable traffic

### 3. Output Generation
- **Cost Estimation**
  - Monthly cost breakdowns by service
  - Cost comparison between different architectures
  - Scaling cost projections
  - Regional pricing considerations

- **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Visual service topology
  - Data flow representations
  - Network architecture diagrams
  - Security boundary illustrations

- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - Terraform module generation
  - Resource configuration templates
  - Variable definitions and defaults
  - Best practice security configurations

## User Experience Requirements
- Clean, intuitive interface for input collection
- Progressive disclosure of complex options
- Real-time cost updates as selections change
- Exportable reports and diagrams
- Shareable architecture recommendations
