# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Analyze Page is a core feature of Cloud Opti that allows users to input a GitHub repository URL and receive intelligent cloud architecture recommendations based on automated code analysis. This page serves as the primary entry point for users who have existing codebases and want to optimize their cloud infrastructure costs and architecture decisions.

The page will analyze the repository's technology stack, dependencies, architecture patterns, and provide tailored recommendations for cloud services across AWS, Azure, and GCP with detailed cost estimates and reasoning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input a GitHub repository URL so that I can get cloud architecture recommendations for my existing project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the analyze page THEN the system SHALL display a clean input form with a GitHub URL field
2. WHEN a user enters a GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and accessibility
3. WHEN a user submits a valid GitHub URL THEN the system SHALL initiate the analysis process
4. IF the GitHub repository is private or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with progress indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time feedback during the analysis process so that I understand what's happening and how long it might take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing current analysis stage
2. WHEN each analysis step completes THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicator and show completion status
3. WHEN analysis encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN analysis takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion time
5. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL offer options to retry or contact support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect my project's technology stack so that I don't have to manually specify all the technologies I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a repository THEN it SHALL detect programming languages from file extensions and content
2. WHEN the system finds package files THEN it SHALL parse dependencies from package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.
3. WHEN the system detects frameworks THEN it SHALL identify React, Vue, Angular, Django, Spring Boot, etc.
4. WHEN the system finds database configurations THEN it SHALL identify database types and usage patterns
5. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display detected technologies with confidence levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and modify the detected technology stack so that I can ensure accuracy before getting recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technology detection completes THEN the system SHALL display all detected technologies in an editable format
2. WHEN a user wants to modify detected technologies THEN the system SHALL provide add/remove/edit capabilities
3. WHEN a user adds a technology THEN the system SHALL validate the selection and update recommendations accordingly
4. WHEN a user removes a detected technology THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and recalculate recommendations
5. WHEN modifications are complete THEN the system SHALL allow users to proceed to architecture recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive cloud architecture recommendations based on my project's specific needs so that I can make informed infrastructure decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technology analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate architecture recommendations for AWS, Azure, and GCP
2. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide reasoning for each suggested service
3. WHEN showing architecture options THEN the system SHALL include cost estimates for each recommendation
4. WHEN presenting multiple options THEN the system SHALL rank recommendations by cost-effectiveness
5. WHEN recommendations are ready THEN the system SHALL allow users to view detailed architecture diagrams

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see estimated costs for recommended architectures so that I can budget appropriately for my cloud infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN architecture recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate monthly cost estimates
2. WHEN displaying costs THEN the system SHALL break down pricing by service category
3. WHEN showing cost estimates THEN the system SHALL include scaling projections for different traffic levels
4. WHEN comparing options THEN the system SHALL highlight cost differences between cloud providers
5. WHEN costs are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide cost optimization suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate to detailed results and export options so that I can share recommendations with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to detailed results page
2. WHEN users want to save results THEN the system SHALL offer export options for recommendations
3. WHEN users want to share results THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links with analysis results
4. WHEN users want to start over THEN the system SHALL provide clear options to analyze a different repository
5. WHEN users navigate away THEN the system SHALL preserve analysis results for return visits

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the analyze page to be accessible and performant so that I can use it effectively regardless of my abilities or device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all content SHALL be properly announced with appropriate labels
4. WHEN the page loads on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and usable
5. WHEN analysis is running THEN the page SHALL remain responsive and not block user interaction
